The Wallet is an Android application to keep track of the user's budget. This project was a group project done when I was a freshman in college. The project was written in Android Studio. Feel free to take a look at the code. There is also an apk file in the project. It can be used to install the application into an Android device.

The application has several functionalities. The user can store their incomes and expenses. The user can also add their credit cards. However, The Wallet only sotres the aliases of credit cards but not the information. This function is only for users to enter how much they spent with that card. For incomes, users can set regular income sources. These incomes will be added in desired day of every month until they are cancelled by the user. Other than that, irregular incomes or bonuses can be added anytime. For the expenses, user can add single entries or create installment plans. These income and expense entries can also store more information, like their type or other description.
